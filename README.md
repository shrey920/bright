Bright 
====

A linux kernel module to control display brightness using keyboard.
This is an experiment to fiddle with drivers. It may not have any real life use case but was fun to create.

### To install

```sh
$ ./m.sh
```

### To run the driver

```sh
$ ./b.sh
```
Type 'b' for increasing brightness and 'v' for decreasing.
